## Cockburn Sound model : ocean boundary condition files (biogeochemistry)

<br>

This folder contains the outputs from analysis undertaken of ocean biogeochemical variables in Perth offshore waters for the purposes of specifying ocean boundary condition values required for the AED biogeochemical model. 

The files include time-series of oxygen, nutrients and plankton specific to the CSIEM model domain boundary.

Scripts for creating the ocean BGC time-series are available within this Github repo:

Files in this folder include (Apr 2023):

```
ocean_bgc_a_20130101_20131231
```

(was CS_obc_WQ_NS3_20130101_20131231)


These files are not stored in GitHub and can be accessed from the CSIEM model archive on Pawsey:

```
wamsi: wamsi-westport-project-1/tfvaed/bc_repo
```
